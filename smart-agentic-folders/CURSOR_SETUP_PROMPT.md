## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT TO DO**

Please help me set up a **Smart Agentic Project Foldersâ„¢** system for my new project. This is a revolutionary AI-powered project organization methodology that includes:

1. **Interactive Dashboard** - Streamlit-based command center
2. **AI Assistant** - Context-aware project guidance  
3. **Muscle Memory** - Workflow pattern learning
4. **Visual Roadmap** - Progress tracking and milestones
5. **Team Collaboration** - Shared progress without competition

## ðŸ“‹ **SETUP STEPS**

### **STEP 1: Project Onboarding**
First, run an interactive questionnaire to understand my project:

**Questions to ask me:**
- Project name and type (Software/Research/Business/Creative/Consulting)
- Timeline and team size
- Technology stack and infrastructure
- Primary goals and success metrics
- Team collaboration style
- Organization preferences (ADHD-friendly? Visual? Detailed?)
- Biggest expected challenges

### **STEP 2: Generate Core Files**
Based on my answers, create these files:

1. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - ADHD-friendly project overview
2. **`project_dashboard.py`** - Customized Streamlit command center
3. **`project_muscle_memory.py`** - Workflow optimization engine
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Project-specific dependencies
5. **`README.md`** - Quick start guide
6. **`.gitignore`** - Smart exclusions
7. **`.project_config.json`** - Configuration storage

### **STEP 3: Dashboard Features**
The dashboard should include these pages:
- **Project Overview** - Metrics, progress, team status
- **Project Roadmap** - Phases, milestones, timeline
- **AI Assistant** - Chat interface with project context
- **Role Tracker** - Team responsibilities (if applicable)
- **Progress Analytics** - Development velocity, optimization
- **Team Collaboration** - Shared goals (NO competition/leaderboards)

### **STEP 4: AI Integration**
Set up context-aware AI assistant that knows:
- Full project context and goals
- Team structure and responsibilities  
- Technical stack and architecture
- Current progress and challenges
- Success metrics and timeline

## ðŸŽ¨ **CUSTOMIZATION BASED ON PROJECT TYPE**

**Software Projects**: Focus on code quality, performance, scalability

**Business Projects**: Revenue tracking, market analysis, growth metrics
**Creative Projects**: Portfolio management, client feedback, iterations
**Consulting Projects**: Client deliverables, timeline management, satisfaction

## ðŸš€ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After setup, I should be able to:
1. Run `streamlit run project_dashboard.py` 
2. See a beautiful, customized command center
3. Chat with an AI that knows my project inside-out
4. Track progress automatically via Git integration
5. Share dashboard URL with team for instant alignment
6. Get optimization insights from Muscle Memory patterns

## ðŸ’¡ **KEY PRINCIPLES**

- **ADHD-Friendly**: Visual, quick-access, organized
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared success, no individual competition
- **AI-Powered**: Context-aware assistance and guidance
